# quietly existing

A simple bot for allowing users to send anonymous messages. It is recommended that you only grant the bot permissions to access a dedicated channel for sending such anonymized messages. If a channel named `#quietly-existing-logs` exists in the server, the user who sent the message will be logged, along with the message they sent (for moderation purposes). Note that the bot will need permissions to this channel, too (if such logging is desirable).

Feel free to add the public instance of the bot to your server, or host it yourself. It doesn't take a lot of resources to host. Keep in mind that the bot is [AGPL LICENSED](LICENSE), so any changes to the bot's source code must be published in order to host that modified version of the bot.

The bot provides exactly one slash command, namely `/quietly`.

# Privacy Policy

This bot does not log any of the mssages it anonymizes to the server it runs on in the publicly available instance. Don't believe us? Check the code! Open source software is amazing that way.

We can't prove that the code on the server is what is running on the public instance due to the way Discord bots work. So if you have any concerns, you can feel free to self-host the bot.

# Terms of Service

We assume no liability for messages sent using this bot. Nor do we provide any guarantee of the public instance's uptime/downtime. If you encounter a bug, please feel free to file a GitHub issue in relation. You can even submit a pull request!
