# quietly-existing

A simple bot for allowing users to send anonymous messages. It is recommended that you only grant the bot permissions to access a dedicated channel for sending such anonymized messages. If a channel named `#quietly-existing-logs` exists in the server, the user who sent the message will be logged, along with the message they sent (for moderation purposes). Note that the bot will need permissions to this channel, too (if such logging is desirable).
